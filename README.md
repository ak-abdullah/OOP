# ðŸ“’ Contact Book Application

A console-based Contact Management System developed as a final project for the **Object-Oriented Programming Lab** course. This project demonstrates core OOP principles such as **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **operator overloading**, **templates**, and **file handling** using C++.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Applied

- Object-Oriented Design (OOP)
- Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- Operator Overloading
- Templates (where applicable)
- File Handling (Save & Load contacts)
- Three-file structure (`.h` and `.cpp`)
- Exception handling
- Clean code (SRP, Rule of Three, naming conventions)

## ðŸš€ Features

- Create a contact book of any size
- Add, display, and search contacts
- Sort contacts by first or last name
- Merge duplicate contacts
- Save and load contacts from file
- Show total number of contacts
- Menu-driven interface
